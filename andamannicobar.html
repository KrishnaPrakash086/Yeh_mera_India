        <H3>The names ‘Andaman’ and ‘Nicobar’ are taken from the Malay Language </H3>
        The name Andaman is presumed to be derived from Hanuman, who was known to the Malays as Handuman. The name Nicobar seems to be a corruption of the South Indian term ‘Nakkavaram’ (Land of the Naked) as indicated in the great Tanjore inscription of AD 1050.
       </li>

       <li> 
        <H3>The most widely spoken language on the islands is not Andamanese or Nicobarese </H3>

The nesting population of Leatherback turtles in Nicobar is one of the few colonies that exceeds 1,000 individuals in the Indo-Pacific, and is hence of global importance.
